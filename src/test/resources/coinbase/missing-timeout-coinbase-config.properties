# This value is in SECONDS. It is the timeout value that the exchange adapter will wait on socket connect/socket read
# when communicating with the exchange. Once this threshold has been breached, the exchange adapter will give up and
# throw a Trading API TimeoutException.
#
# The exchange adapter is single threaded: if one request gets blocked, it will block all subsequent requests from
# getting to the exchange. This timeout prevents an indefinite block.
#
# You'll need to experiment with values here.
